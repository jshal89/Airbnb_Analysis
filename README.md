## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Apart from libraries available in the Anaconda distribution of Python 3.*, this code also uses the vaderSentiment library.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project uses 2016-2017 Airbnb listings from Seattle and Boston to examine the following questions:

1. How do prices compare between Boston and Seattle? How does pricing look across neighborhoods?
2. How are other attributes of the listing related to pricing and availability?
3. Are the factors related to price and availability different in Boston and Seattle?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

All code for this analysis is contained in a single .ipynb. The notebook contains functions used to clean and prepare data, along with markdown cells that provide labelling and explanation for analysis steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
